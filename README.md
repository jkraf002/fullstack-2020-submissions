# Fullstack 2020 open

[Fullstack 2020 open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course is offered online by the Department of Computer Science at the Universeity of Helsinki.

The course is split into 10 parts:  
Part 0: Fundamentals of Web apps  
Part 1: Introduction to React  
Part 2: Communicating with server  
Part 3: Programming a server with NodeJS and Express  
Part 4: Testing Express servers, user administration  
Part 5: Testing React apps  
Part 6: State management with Redux  
Part 7: React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack  
Part 8: GraphQL  
Part 9: Typescript

This repository is where I'll be storing solutions to the course exercises.
